# PancreasDxNet
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with the five-year survival rate of only 13% largely due to late-stage diagnosis. Accurate and early detection is critical for improving survival outcomes.
Considering the importance and prevalence of pancreatic cancer worldwide, we trained an effective CNN-based multiclass classification model to classify computed tomography (CT) scan images of pancreas into three classes such as pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis and normal pancreas. The ResNet50-based CNN model achieved highest average accuracy of 99.26% and 99.16% on the validation and additional test set.

PancreasDxNet (Pancreatic Diagnosis Network) is a deep convolutional neural network designed for automated multi-class classification of pancreatic CT images into pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, and normal pancreas.

## Usage

This repository supports two modes of prediction:

### Option 1: Script-Based Prediction

> **_NOTE:_** Remember to activate the corresponding conda environment before running the script, if applicable.

**Input**: Image file (image.jpg)

**Output**: Prediction file

**Execution:**

**Step 1**: Download this repository, extract zipped file and ensure that all the files are present in the same folder when running the script.

**Step 2**: Install Anaconda3-5.2 or above.

**Step 3**: Before running these scripts, create a new conda environment and install the following packages using the pip command (pip install name_of_package = version)
            Install or upgrade libraries mentioned above (python, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, scipy).

**Step 4**: Save the images to be predicted in "Images" folder

**Step 5**: Execute the script ``prediction_pc.py``.

    python prediction_pc.py

The script runs in the current directory.

**Step 6**: Prediction results will be saved in `predictions.csv` which includes predicted output prediction class of pacreas CT images with probility of prediction.

### Option 2: Streamlit Web App

Install all dependencies using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the interactive application:

    streamlit run app.py

Then open in browser:

http://localhost:8501

Steps:

Upload a CT scan image
Click Predict
View predicted class and probabilities
